<h3 align="center">A FrontEnd Web Developer who Loves to Build Pixel Perfect Web App Interfaces.</h3>
 
 ## ðŸ§­ &nbsp;About Me
- I build highly Responsive (Mobile-First) Websites/Single Page Applications with modern web development technologies that include HTML, CSS, BootStrap, Vanilla JS & React, but not just limited to these.  

- I also have 2 years of professional experience for Agile Software Management while providing L2 Production Support for international clients and maintaining 100% uptime of the tier 1 banking applications like MTS.   

- As part of being a Web Developer, Iâ€™m also comfortable working with version controls such as Github, Gitlab, and Bitbucket.  
- While continuously upgrading my tech stack & good communication skills Iâ€™ll prove to be playing a vital role in any Team/Project that I partake in.   

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any of the above **technologies**, or would you like to setup an **Interview**? Checkout my [Resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KKRFAj2Bqax-j4Gq4LcCu140RnkdBCGi/view).
